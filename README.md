Each subsequent level sub-divides the previous in roughly 7 hexagons. | 3 |
| hex-polygon-margin | Hexed polygon object accessor function, attribute or a numeric constant for the radial margin of each hexagon. Margins above `0` will create gaps between adjacent hexagons within a polygon. The margin is specified in terms of fraction of the hexagon's surface diameter. Values below `0` or above `1` are disadvised. | 0.2 |
| hex-polygon-curvature-resolution | Hexed polygon object accessor function, attribute or a numeric constant for the resolution (in angular degrees) of each hexed polygon surface curvature. The finer the resolution, the more the polygon hexes are fragmented into smaller faces to approximate the spheric surface, at the cost of performance. | 5 |
| hex-polygons-transition-duration | Getter/setter for duration (ms) of the transition to animate hexed polygons altitude and margin changes. A value of `0` will move the hexagons immediately to their final state. New hexed polygons are animated by sizing each hexagon from `0` radius. | 0 |
